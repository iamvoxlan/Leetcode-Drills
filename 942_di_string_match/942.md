# 942. DI String Match
## Description
A permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] can be represented as a string s of length n where:

    s[i] == 'I' if perm[i] < perm[i + 1], and
    s[i] == 'D' if perm[i] > perm[i + 1].

Given a string s, reconstruct the permutation perm and return it. If there are multiple valid permutations perm, return any of them.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "IDID"
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]

Example 2:

Input: s = "III"
Output: [0,1,2,3]

Example 3:

Input: s = "DDI"
Output: [3,2,0,1]

 

Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is either 'I' or 'D'.





## Problem Solving

In this problem, we will try to construct a permutation **perm**, given a string **s** consist of **n** characters, and then we will return a permutation **perm** with **n+1** integer from **0..n**

The string only contains 2 letter, **I** and **D**. The value of perm[i] will be **less than** perm[i+1] when the s[i] equals I, otherwhise if the s[i] value equals to D, then the value of perm[i] > perm[i+1].

We can assume for every permutation **perm**, there will be at least one permutation where string s starts with letter 'I' on s[0], the value of perm[i] will be the lowest, which is 0 since there's a rule where the value of perm[i] < perm[i+1] if s[i] == 'I', or perm[0] will always be the largest number, which is n if s[0] == 'D'.

So we will starts filling with perm[0], and then continnue to iterate over the string to index n-1. Before starting the iteration, we need to keep track on minimum and maximum value that hasn't been occupied or filled into the perm array. The minimum value will always be 0, and the maxiumum value will always be n.


For every iteration from index 0 to n-1, we will  fill the value of perm[i] based on the value of s[i]. We will fill perm[i] value based on s[i] value, if it's equals to 'I' then perm[i] will be filled with minimum value, otherwise filled with maximum value. For every time we decide to fill the perm[i] with minimum value, we need to increment the minimum variable to keep track on minimum value that still available, otherwise decrease the value of maximum variable available.

Since we only loop for n characters, there will always perm[n] that will be left empty or by default the value is 0 since we don't iterate to index n. For this one we can fill the value with latest minimum variable value.
